# Day 11: Monkey in the Middle 

### --- Part One ---

As you finally start making your way upriver, you realize your pack is much lighter than you remember. Just then, one of the items from your pack goes flying overhead. Monkeys are playing [Keep Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_away) with your missing things!

To get your stuff back, you need to be able to predict where the monkeys will throw your items. After some careful observation, you realize the monkeys operate based on **how worried you are about each item.**

You take some notes (your puzzle input) on the items each monkey currently has, how worried you are about those items, and how the monkey makes decisions based on your worry level. For example:

```
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 1:
  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old + 6
  Test: divisible by 19
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 0

Monkey 2:
  Starting items: 79, 60, 97
  Operation: new = old * old
  Test: divisible by 13
    If true: throw to monkey 1
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 3:
  Starting items: 74
  Operation: new = old + 3
  Test: divisible by 17
    If true: throw to monkey 0
    If false: throw to monkey 1
```

Each monkey has several attributes:

- `Starting items` lists your worry level for each item the monkey is currently holding in the order they will be inspected.
- `Operation` shows how your worry level changes as that monkey inspects an item. (An operation like `new = old * 5` means that your worry level after the monkey inspected the item is five times whatever your worry level was before inspection.)
- `Test` shows how the monkey uses your worry level to decide where to throw an item next.
  - If `true` shows what happens with an item if the `Test` was true.
  - If `false` shows what happens with an item if the `Test` was false.

After each monkey inspects an item but before it tests your worry level, your relief that the monkey's inspection didn't damage the item causes your worry level to be **divided by three** and rounded down to the nearest integer.

The monkeys take turns inspecting and throwing items. On a single monkey's **turn**, it inspects and throws all of the items it is holding one at a time and in the order listed. Monkey `0` goes first, then monkey 1, and so on until each monkey has had one turn. The process of each monkey taking a single turn is called a **round**.

When a monkey throws an item to another monkey, the item goes on the **end** of the recipient monkey's list. A monkey that starts a round with no items could end up inspecting and throwing many items by the time its turn comes around. If a monkey is holding no items at the start of its turn, its turn ends.

In the above example, the first round proceeds as follows:

```

After round 1, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:

```

Monkeys 2 and 3 aren't holding any items at the end of the round; they both inspected items during the round and threw them all before the round ended.

This process continues for a few more rounds:

```
After round 2, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 695, 10, 71, 135, 350
Monkey 1: 43, 49, 58, 55, 362

Monkey 1: 110, 36
Monkey 2: 
Monkey 3: 

...

After round 20, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 10, 12, 14, 26, 34
Monkey 1: 245, 93, 53, 199, 115
Monkey 2: 
Monkey 3: 
```

Chasing all of the monkeys at once is impossible; you're going to have to focus on the **two most active** monkeys if you want any hope of getting your stuff back. Count the **total number of times each monkey inspects items** over 20 rounds:

```
Monkey 0 inspected items 101 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 95 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 7 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 105 times.
```

In this example, the two most active monkeys inspected items 101 and 105 times. The level of **monkey business** in this situation can be found by multiplying these together: *`10605`*.

Figure out which monkeys to chase by counting how many items they inspect over 20 rounds. **What is the level of monkey business after 20 rounds of stuff-slinging simian shenanigans?**

### --- Part Two ---

It seems like the `X` register controls the horizontal position of a [sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)). Specifically, the sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the `X` register sets the horizontal position of the **middle** of that sprite. (In this system, there is no such thing as "vertical position": if the sprite's horizontal position puts its pixels where the CRT is currently drawing, then those pixels will be drawn.)

You count the pixels on the CRT: 40 wide and 6 high. This CRT screen draws the top row of pixels left-to-right, then the row below that, and so on. The left-most pixel in each row is in position `0`, and the right-most pixel in each row is in position `39`.

Like the CPU, the CRT is tied closely to the clock circuit: the CRT draws **a single pixel during each cycle**. Representing each pixel of the screen as a `#`, here are the cycles during which the first and last pixel in each row are drawn:

```
Cycle   1 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  40
Cycle  41 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  80
Cycle  81 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 120
Cycle 121 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 160
Cycle 161 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 200
Cycle 201 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 240
```

So, by [carefully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_the_Beam) [timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFnWZH5FXc) the CPU instructions and the CRT drawing operations, you should be able to determine whether the sprite is visible the instant each pixel is drawn. If the sprite is positioned such that one of its three pixels is the pixel currently being drawn, the screen produces a **lit** pixel (`#`); otherwise, the screen leaves the pixel **dark** (`.`).

The first few pixels from the larger example above are drawn as follows:

```

Allowing the program to run to completion causes the CRT to produce the following image:
